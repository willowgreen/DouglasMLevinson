    <quote>I'm trained classically, I'm trained contemporaneously, and you suck!</quote>
    <quote>I don't care about your little horn lip, it doesn't mean you know how to play!</quote>
    <quote>You're flat! You can't even carry a fucking note!</quote>
    <quote>If you really have talent, go practice. And then get yourself a gig, instead of ruining the end of the day for everybody down here!</quote>
